# Lukas's dotfiles
Run symlinks to create, you guessed it, symlinks. (Edit $home, $dotfiles etc as you need)
In my experience symlinks can break really easily so keep a backup of your dotfiles.

To use suckless, delete the empty folder and clone lukass4/suckless into the dotfiles folder then run the symlinks.

Packages (that I can remember) on pacman or yay: firefox zsh mpv pulsemixer feh exa ffmpeg picom ttf-hack ttf-meslo-nerd noto-fonts-emoji xbindkeys xclip xorg-setxkbmap xorg-xrandr xorg-xset dunst flameshot gnome-themes-extra neovim

To install spotify-player run: `cargo install spotify-player --features lyric-finder notify`
